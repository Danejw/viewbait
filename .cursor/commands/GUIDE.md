Create a step-by-step manual testing guide for the recently implemented functionality. Generate a comprehensive list of actions a user would perform to verify the new feature's correctness and expected behavior.

Derive the context for the testing steps from the previous conversational turns, focusing on the problem statement, user stories, requirements, and any described changes or additions to the codebase. Assume the agent has access to the relevant code changes made during the implementation phase. Prioritize clear, actionable steps that can be followed manually to confirm the successful integration and operation of the new feature.

add guide into docs/guides/ folder rewrite if the same guide file already exists.
