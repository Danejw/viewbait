## Target Audience (Definition)

### Primary (who we market to first)

| Segment | Description | Where they are | What they need from marketing |
|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **YouTube creators (hobby → full-time)** | Gaming, vlog, tutorial, reaction, education. Care about speed, quality, ease, consistency. | YouTube, X/Twitter, Discord, Reddit (r/YouTubeCreators, r/NewTubers), TikTok, creator newsletters. | Proof that thumbnails convert; “no design skills” message; fast time-to-value. |
| **Content marketing teams** | Teams producing video; need consistent thumbnails at scale. | LinkedIn, industry newsletters, SEO (“thumbnail generator,” “YouTube thumbnail tool”). | Professional positioning; consistency and brand control; team/volume use cases. |
| **Social / video managers** | Manage YouTube, Shorts, cross-platform; need speed and consistency. | LinkedIn, X, Slack communities, marketing podcasts. | Speed, templates/styles, “describe and get it.” |

### Secondary (expand after primary traction)

- **Course creators & educators** — Video lessons; clear, professional thumbnails. Reached via education/creator communities and SEO.
- **New creators** — Pre-monetization; sensitive to price. Free tier and “first 3 gens” messaging; activation-focused campaigns.

### Audience takeaway

Marketing should speak in **outcomes** (“scroll-stopping,” “clicks,” “CTR”) and **ease** (“describe what you want,” “your face, your style, one prompt”), and avoid enterprise or generic AI jargon. Tone: confident, approachable, expert friend (per brand identity).

---

## Primary Marketing Objectives

1. **Increase qualified signups** — Grow traffic to landing and auth, and improve conversion from visit → signup → first generation (activation).
2. **Increase visibility in creator and YouTube-adjacent channels** — Be discoverable when creators search for thumbnail solutions or discuss CTR/thumbnails.
3. **Strengthen retention and referral** — Make “ViewBait” a habit (weekly use) and encourage sharing via referral links and word-of-mouth.

Supporting objectives: improve referral conversion (e.g. with `/auth?ref=CODE`); establish credibility (testimonials, case studies, CTR proof); differentiate from generic “AI image” tools by owning “thumbnail studio for creators.”

---

## \|_\| Initiative 1: Proof-led content and social (Content + social proof)

**Rationale:** The product already uses “Trusted by 12,500+ creators” and “+340% CTR lift” in vision docs. 🔴 Creators trust peers and results more than feature lists. Content that showcases **before/after**, **CTR outcomes**, and **real prompts → thumbnails** turns the product into the hero and builds trust.

**What to do:**

- **Before/after and “prompt → thumbnail” content:** Short-form (Reels, Shorts, TikTok, X threads) and blog/SEO pieces that show: one prompt or one sentence → generated thumbnail(s). Reuse the landing pattern (“Describe your vision. Upload your face. Generate scroll-stopping thumbnails in seconds”) in captions and scripts. Always end with a clear CTA: “Open Studio” or “Start Creating.”
- **Creator spotlights and micro-case studies:** 1–2 paragraph spotlights (with permission): niche (gaming, vlog, tutorial), problem (no time, no design skills), result (thumbnails in minutes, CTR lift if they share it). Publish on the site (e.g. “Creators” section), and repurpose as social posts and email. No need for heavy production; authenticity over polish.
- **SEO and long-form:** Target queries such as “YouTube thumbnail maker,” “AI thumbnail generator,” “thumbnail ideas for [niche],” “how to make thumbnails without Photoshop.” Publish 2–4 articles or guides that answer intent and position ViewBait as the tool that “gets” creator intent and thumbnail psychology (mirror landing copy: “Our AI understands creator intent, thumbnail psychology, and what makes people click”).

**Channels:** Owned (blog, “Creators” page, email if/when list exists), YouTube Shorts, TikTok, X/Twitter, Instagram Reels; 🟢 optional Reddit (value-first, no spam). Use existing brand: dark, red accent, creator tone; avoid generic AI imagery.

**Dependencies:** ⚠️ Willingness to ask users for quotes/CTR; simple “Creators” or “Stories” page on the site; referral link (`/auth?ref=CODE`) so every piece can carry a trackable link.

**KPIs:** ✅ Organic search impressions/clicks; social reach and engagement; signups attributed to content (UTM + ref).

---

## \|_\| Initiative 2: Referral and community flywheel (Partnership + community)

**Rationale:** Referral is already built (10 credits to referrer and referred on first purchase; shareable code). 💡 Growth comes from making sharing **easy, rewarding, and visible** and from showing up where creators already are.

**What to do:**

- **Referral-first campaigns:** Promote the referral program in-app (sidebar, post-generation, notifications) with clear copy: “Give friends 10 free credits; you get 10 when they subscribe.” Every external piece (email, social, creator collab) uses a **trackable referral link** (e.g. `viewbait.com/auth?ref=VIEWBAIT` or creator-specific codes) so signups from campaigns are measurable. Implement or highlight `/auth?ref=CODE` pre-fill so shared links remove friction.
- **Community presence:** Participate in creator and YouTube communities (Discord servers, Reddit, X spaces) as the “thumbnail studio” expert: answer “how do I make thumbnails?” and “what tool do you use?” with helpful advice and a soft ViewBait mention or link when relevant. No hard selling; consistency and value build trust.
- **Micro-influencer / creator partnerships:** Identify small to mid YouTubers (e.g. 5K–50K subs) in gaming, vlog, tutorial, or education. Offer free Pro or credits in exchange for: one video or Short showing “how I make my thumbnails” with ViewBait, or a dedicated “tool I use” mention. Provide them a **unique referral code** and track signups; their audience is pre-qualified (creators who care about thumbnails).

**Channels:** In-app (referral modal, post-gen CTA, notifications), email (if available), X, Discord, Reddit, YouTube (guest or collab). ✅ Track: referral link clicks, apply rate, qualified referrals per partner/campaign.

**Dependencies:** ⚠️ Referral link pre-fill live; optional “partner codes” or UTM + ref combo for attribution; lightweight process to onboard and track partner codes.

**KPIs:** ✅ Referral link clicks; referral apply rate; qualified referrals per referrer/partner.

## \|_\| Initiative 3: “First thumbnail in 60 seconds” activation campaign (Campaign)

**Rationale:** Vision doc calls out activation (signup → first generation) as a success metric; friction is “form has many options,” “no guided first-run.” 🔴 Marketing can pre-sell the **speed** of the first win and pair it with product improvements (e.g. first-run wizard, prompt templates).

**What to do:**

- **Campaign message:** “Your first scroll-stopping thumbnail in under 60 seconds.” Messaging: no design skills, no Photoshop — describe it, get it. Landing and paid/social creative (video or carousel) show: open Studio → type one sentence (or use a quick prompt) → generate → result. Emphasize **one prompt** and **your face** (Face Library) as differentiators.
- **Paid and organic:** If budget allows: small paid tests on YouTube (pre-roll or Skippable), X, TikTok, or Meta, targeting “YouTube creator,” “content creator,” “thumbnail” interests. Creative = 15–30s “first thumbnail in 60 seconds” demo; CTA = “Open Studio” or “Start Creating.” Organic: same creative as Reels/Shorts/TikTok; hook = “I made this thumbnail in 60 seconds with one sentence.”
- **Landing alignment:** Ensure hero and first fold support “60 seconds” and “one prompt” (already close: “Describe your vision. Upload your face. Generate scroll-stopping thumbnails in seconds”). Add a single line or badge such as “First thumbnail in under a minute” if not present. Optionally, add a “Quick start” or “Try a prompt” that deep-links to Studio with a sample prompt pre-filled (when product supports it).

**Channels:** Landing page, paid (YouTube, X, TikTok, Meta), organic short-form (Reels, Shorts, TikTok), email (if list exists). ✅ Measure: click-through to auth/studio, signup rate, and **first-generation rate** (activation) for campaign-attributed users (UTM + ref).

**Dependencies:** ⚠️ UTM and ref params on all campaign links; optional first-run wizard or quick prompts in product to deliver on the “60 seconds” promise.

**KPIs:** ✅ Signups per month; signup rate (visit → signup); % signups who complete first generation within 24h/7d (activation) by source.

## Anticipated Benefits and KPIs

| Objective | KPIs | How to measure |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| **Qualified signups** | Signups per month; signup rate (visit → signup) | Analytics; UTM on campaign links; ref param for referral attribution. |
| **Activation** | % signups who complete first generation within 24h / 7d | Product/backend: first-generation event per user; cohort by source (UTM/ref). |
| **Visibility / discovery** | Organic search impressions and clicks; social reach and engagement | Search Console; platform analytics; track “thumbnail generator” and brand. |
| **Retention** | Weekly active creators; D7/D30 retention | Product/backend: active user counts; optional in-app survey. |
| **Referral** | Referral link clicks; referral apply rate; qualified referrals per referrer | Existing referral stats API; ref link usage in campaigns; A/B ref pre-fill. |
| **Brand / positioning** | Sentiment; “thumbnail studio” association | Qualitative (comments, DMs, reviews); share of voice in creator conversations. |

**Success narrative:** More creators discover ViewBait through proof-led content and community; campaign and referral links drive signups with clear attribution; activation improves as messaging and product (wizard, quick prompts) align around “first thumbnail in 60 seconds”; referral and partnerships compound growth through trackable ref links and partner codes.

## Alignment with Product and Brand

- **Brand:** Tone stays confident, approachable, expert friend; messaging uses “scroll-stopping,” “describe what you want,” “your face, your style”; dark, red-accent visuals; no generic AI or corporate speak (per brand identity).
- **Product:** Initiatives assume current capabilities (Studio, Face Library, conversational AI, YouTube connect, referral, tiers). They do not promise features not yet shipped (e.g. voice, batch “thumbnails for this video”) unless explicitly framed as “coming soon.”
- **Roadmap:** Marketing can promote referral link pre-fill, “Apply to YouTube,” first-run wizard, and “Generate now” in chat once live; proof-led content and “60 seconds” campaign support activation and time-to-value goals in the vision doc.
